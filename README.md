# progmodes -- a work in process on the pascal-mode of Emacs

I have some issues with the standard Pascal programming mode of Emacs. I've grabbed the current source for pascal.el from the main gnu git at savannah.gnu.org and along with some other mode definitions for reference purposes. I've also grabbed the standard README and COPYING for attribution.

Slow work in progress.
