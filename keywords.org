* pascal keywords

The primary source for this is _Standard Pascal User Reference Manual_ by Doug Cooper which elucidates the ISO 7185 Standard Pascal.

As the only compiler I'm working with is Free Pascal 3.2.2, and it's around forty years since the original standard was published, a few more reserved types and minimal extensions (break, continue, exit, etc.) are included.
